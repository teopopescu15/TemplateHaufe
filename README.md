# Hackathon Challenge: AI-Powered Code Review Assistant

## Objective

Build a functional product capable of performing automated code reviews, providing valuable insights and recommendations for developers.

Your solution should analyze source code, detect potential issues, and assist in improving code quality. Use AI where appropriate — ideally through a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM) to ensure privacy, performance, and innovation.
